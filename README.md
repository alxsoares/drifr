Decomposite Recentered Influence Function using R
Decompositing Methods used to decompose the difference in a distributional statsitic between two groups, or its change over time, into 
various explanatory factors is important research issue in economy. The Recentered Influence Function(RIF) generalized the mean
decomposition to other distributional statistics like quantiles, gini coefficient or the variance. The package `drifr` provides:
* The recentred influence function for different distributional statistics
   * mean, quantile, vairance, gini coefficient
* The decomposition method based on the RIF regression results, expecially generalized the decomposition into multi-dimensional
